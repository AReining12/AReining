Browser used: Firefox

Interactive elements: Education (carousel), Experience (accordion), hobbies page photos (photos change on mouseover)
Dynamic elements: Clock displayed in nav bar updates every second, icon displayed in nav bar updates 4 times per day 

Problems: I was not able to get the style to work properly without linking my html file to bootstrap.css via cdn. 
    I tried redownloading bootstrap and replacing the file, copying the file directly from the linked css file, and 
    pasting the css directly into the style section of my html file. Because of this my external stylesheet only contains
    the css I wrote.

Bootstrap components used:
grid, accordion, carousel, nav bar, card

Breakpoints to check: 
Small: >= 576
Medium: >= 768
Large: >= 992

The only differences between medium and large occur on the hobbies page.
